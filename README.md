**OVERVIEW**

_part_1_mars_news.ipynb_ 
This code goes to "https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html" and summarizes the articales listed on this site.  The saves the information in a Python list of dictionaries.

_part_2_mars_news.ipynb_
This code anylizes the Mars Temperature Data table at "https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html".  It looks at the temperatures, and atmospheric pressure on Mars by Martian months.  Finally, the Martian year is compared to the Earth year.  All the data pulled was save to _mars_temperature_data.csv._



**OBSERVATIONS**

The average low temperatures on Mars are far below the freezing point on Earth (0 Â°C).  The coldest month is the third month and the warmest is the eigth as shown a the graph below.

While the lowest average atmosperic pressure occures during the sixth month and the highest happens during the nineth month as shown on the chart below.

In order to see how the length of Martian year compares with the length of Earth year, the temperatures were plotted by Earth (terrestrial) days.  In the graph below, the Martian year is seen by the cycles.  There is just under 3 Marthian years of data observed. The first year on the graph looks to end around day 650.  The Martian year is almost 300 days longer than the Earth year.
